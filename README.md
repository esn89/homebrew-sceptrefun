# Dependencies
brew install mplayer

# How to:
`cp sceptrefun/sceptrefun /usr/local/bin/` to any place in your $PATH - I used /usr/local/bin
`cp -r assets/ ~/Downloads/`
Make sure it is executable:
`chmod u+x /usr/local/bin/sceptrefun`

run like `sceptrefun $action $env $stack`
add -t, -p, -z for Starcraft sounds

If you trust me to not fuck your sceptre up and want to stop
typing `sceptrefun` everytime, put this in your ~/.zshrc or
~/.bashrc:

alias `sceptre=/usr/local/bin/sceptrefun`
